* Akima subspline interpolation algorithm.

* References
* ----------
*
* Hiroshi Akima, A new method of interpolation and smooth curve fitting based
* on local procedures</em>, Journal of the ACM, Vol. 17, No. 4, October 1970,
* pages 589-602.
*
* Implementation
* --------------
*
* Our implementation is based on the book:
*
* Numerical Algorithms with C, by G. Engeln-Mullges and F. Uhlig (Springer,
* 1996), section 13.1.
*
* We properly represent corners when a data point lies between two adjacent
* straight lines with different slopes. This means that our implementation
* does not impose continuous differentiability, which deviates from the
* original work by Akima. Supporting the accurate representation of corners
* has several practical advantages in our opinion; one of them is the enhanced
* flexibility for the application of Akima interpolation to graphical
* representations of curves given by a set of prescribed x,y data points.
*
* Parameters
* ----------
*
* x  Vector of x-values:
*
*    - If x is not empty: Must be a vector of monotonically increasing,
*      distinct values: x[0] < x[1] < ... < x[n-1].
*
*    - If x is empty: The interpolation will use implicit x[i] = i for
*      i = {0,1,...,n-1}.
*
* y  Vector of function values for i = {0,1,...,n-1}.
*
* The length of the y vector (and also the length of a nonempty x vector) must
* be n >= 5. This is because the Akima algorithm requires at least 4
* interpolation subintervals.
